# Useful Scripts

A collection of Bash scripts that I use on a daily basis.

## Install

To install the scripts, you can easily run the [`install.sh`](./install.sh) script. It prompts the used to choose the directory in which the scripts should be installed, and the default path is `/opt/useful-scripts`.

# Uninstall

To uninstall the scripts, you can run the [`uninstall.sh`](uninstall.sh) script. It uses `whiptail` to provide the user with a graphical interface where they can choose individual scripts that should be uninstalled, but there's also an option to uninstall everything.
